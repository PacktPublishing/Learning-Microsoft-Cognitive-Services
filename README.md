# Learning Microsoft Cognitive Services
This is the code repository for [Learning Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-microsoft-cognitive-services?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786467843), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book will introduce you to all 21 APIs released as part of Cognitive Services platform and show you how to leverage their capabilities. More importantly, youâ€™ll see how the power of these APIs can be combined to build real-world apps that have cognitive capabilities. The book is split into three sections: computer vision, speech recognition and language processing, and knowledge and search.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Throughout this book, we will utilize the different APIs to build a smart house application. The application will be created to see how one can imagine a futuristic house to be.

What's common with all the applications that we will build is that they will be Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications. This is fairly well known, and allows us to build applications using the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.

The code will look like the following:
```
public BitmapImage ImageSource
{
    get { return _imageSource; }
    set
    {
        _imageSource = value;
        RaisePropertyChangedEvent("ImageSource");
    }
}
```

To follow the examples in this book you will need Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition or later. You will also need a working Internet connection and a subscription to Microsoft Azure; a trial subscriptions is OK too. To get the full experience of the examples, you should have access to a web camera and have speakers and a microphone connected to the computer; however, neither is mandatory.
